    <p>
       In some of the rounds you might not interact with anyone.
        If this happens, you will be asked to click 'OK' and wait while the other participants make their choices.
    </p>

    <p>
       In each round in which you do interact with someone, you will be paired with a <em>randomly chosen</em> individual.
        This individual is chosen at random again for each round.
    </p>
