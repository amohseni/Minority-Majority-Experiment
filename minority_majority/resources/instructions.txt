## 1 Intro

Welcome to this experiment by UC Irvine. Thank you for participating.

You are about to participate in a study of decision-making, and you will be paid for your participation at the end of this session.  What you earn depends partly on your decisions and partly on the decisions of other participants.

Please turn off your cell phone.

When you are ready, please click continue to go to the instructions.



## 2 Instructions

This experiment will consist of two parts. There will be 60 rounds in each part of the experiment for a total of 120 rounds.

In some of the rounds you might not interact with anyone. If this happens, you will be asked to click 'OK' and wait while the other participants make their choices. 

In each round in which you do interact with someone, you will be paired with a randomly chosen individual. This individual is chosen at random again for each round. 



## 3 Instructions

In an interaction, you and the other individual will each be given the option to choose either 4 or 6.

If your choice plus the other participant's choice add up to less than 10, then you will both receive points according to your choices. If your choice plus the other participant's choice add up to more than 10, then you will both receive 0 points.



## 4 Instructions

Your payment in the experiment will be determined by your success in the experiment.

The computer will randomly choose one round from each part of the experiment for payment. You will be paid $1 for each point you received in these two rounds.

Please click 'Continue' to begin the experiment.
