Title: Participation Approved


Dear participant,

You are approved for the experiment and will receive a qualification to participate in the experiment shortly.

Slightly before 18:00 PST, you will receive a link to the experiment, though the experiment itself will not start until 18:00.

Upon being sent a like to the HIT, please start the experiment precisely at 18:00 PST, and click through the 100 rounds as quickly as possible.

Your goal is to maximize your payoffs, as your performance will impact your final payment.

Recall, you will be paid $2 for participation, up to $4 based on your performance, and an additionally $2 for completion of the experiment. (That is, $4-8).

If you abandon the HIT before completion, or slow down the group through consistently delayed decisions (letting the timer run out on pages), then you will NOT BE PAID.

Please be considerate of others.

Very best!
