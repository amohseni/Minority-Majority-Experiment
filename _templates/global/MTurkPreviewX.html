     <p>
       This questionnaire is meant to recruit workers interested and able to participate
        in a study on interactive decision making.
    </p>

    <p>
       The survey should take around five minutes, after which you will be paid $0.50.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the end of this questionnaire, if you answer the questions correctly and are qualified,
        you may be asked if you wish to participate in a decision-making experiment.
        If you agree to participate, we will send you a link to the HIT for a decision-making experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
        That decision-making experiment will begin today at 18:00 PST, and will consist of 100 rounds of decision-making
        by you and seven other participants.
        If everyone shows up on time and answers the experimental questions quickly,
        the experiment should take approximately 40 minutes.
    </p>

    <p>
        For that experiment, you will be paid $2.00 for participation,
        $2.00 more for completion of the experiment,
        and up to $4.00 based on your performance in the experiment.
        That is, you can make from $4 to $8 for that experiment,
        if the experiment is successfully completed by you and the other participants.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please accept the invitation to that experiment
        only if you plan on participating and completing the experiment.
        If you return or abandon the HIT before the end of the experiment,
        you will not be paid, and the other participants will not receive the full payment possible for completion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Again, that experiment will begin today at 18:00 PST,
        and take approximately 40 minutes to complete.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you.
    </p>
